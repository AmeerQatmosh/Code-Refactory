# Advanced Software Development - Code Refactory

This refactored code addresses the following problems that make it difficult for other programmers to understand the code:

1. Poor variable naming, such us: ans.
2. Magic Numbers, like: 500 in this line of code: "setSize(500, 500);". 
3. No needed classes and methods (not used), such as: class saveAsText.
4. No needed libraries, such as: "java.awt.BorderLayout".

Also in this refractory code , there are these functions: 

1. showSaveConfirmDialog()
2. savePressed()
3. newPressed()
4. cutPressed()
5. copyPressed()
6. pastePressed()
7. filePressed()
8. quitePressed()
9. openPressed()
10. selectAllPressed()

All strings are placed in one file called: "Strings.java"
