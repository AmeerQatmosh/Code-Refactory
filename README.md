# Advanced Software Development
# Code Refactory

This refactored code addresses the following problems:

## 1. Poor variable naming
such us: ans
## 2. Magic Numbers
like 500 in this line of code: setSize(500, 500);
## 3. No needed classes and methods (not used)
such as: class saveAsText
## 4. No needed libraries
such as: java.awt.BorderLayout
